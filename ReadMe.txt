To run the code "Final Code.py" the following libraries must be installed:

- numpy
- spicy
- matplotlib
- os

This can be done by using the following command in the command window:

pip install numpy scipy matplotlib


It must also be ensured that the following modules and data set files are in the working directory

Modules:
- Neural_Network.py
- Create_window.py
- predicted_class_output.py
- Create_traning_window.py

Data Sets:
- D1.mat
- D2.mat
- D3.mat
- D4.mat
- D5.mat
- D6.mat

The code will produce data files D2-6 which each contain the index (spike position) and predicted class value (1-5).
These data files will be stored in a file, the file they will be stored in can be amended by changing the path variable which can be found in the "Data_storage" module
Once the libraries have been installed and the modules and data files are in the working directory the code can be run.
